## MongoDB, Express, EJS, NodeJS Starter

Basterdized version of [@wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos/Learn-Node/tree/master/starter-files) configured for dum dums like me.

## Cherry Picking
I cherry picked the things that worked for me and got rid of those that didn't.

### Keepers
* Refactoring / Config
* Error handler
* Webpack

### Axed
* SCSS
* Pug => EJS: For me, I found I could do more quicker in EJS. Probably b/c it is more literal and I'm a dum dum.

## Heroku
A few tweaks to get it ready for quick deployment to Heroku.
